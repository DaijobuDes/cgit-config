# A path which will be scanned for repositories. If caching is enabled, the result will be
# cached as a cgitrc include-file in the cache directory. If project-list has been defined
# prior to scan-path, scan-path loads only the directories listed in the file pointed to by
# project-list. Be advised that only the global settings taken before the scan-path directive
# will be applied to each repository.
# Default value: none.

# Url which, if specified, will be used as root for all cgit links. It will also cause cgit
# to generate virtual urls, i.e. urls like /cgit/tree/README
# as opposed to ?r=cgit&p=tree&path=README.
# Default value: none.
# NOTE: cgit has recently learned how to use PATH_INFO to achieve the same kind of virtual
# urls, so this option will probably be deprecated.
